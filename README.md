# Analysis-Design
**Introduction**:This repository gives insight into what I have done in terms of understanding data structures and their functions.

**Question 1: What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem that I was having in regards to the projects within this course, 
was dealing with understanding all the concepts of each of the data structures. 
Usually, when it comes to studying, I like to stay focused in an environement, where 
I am not distracted as easily. However, at times the study material becomes too much for me 
to understand, so I end up taking breaks every now and then,

**Question 2: How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
How I approached this issue, was by trying to utilize my resources to my advantage. Of course, I didn't understand
all of what was taught, through the means of online articles. However, I myself choose to be productive, in terms of 
wanting to advance my skills to the next level. Data structures are important to understand because it's imperative that
developers know how to analyze data and the way in it behaves. Especially, in high-tech companies where data is a huge deal for 
clients, who do not want their personal information being exploited. 

**Question 3: How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I took advantage of the tutoring resources at SNHU to help me get projects done quicker. That also includes listening
to music such as Lofi radio to keep my mind in the loop, so that I do not stray off course. But, in terms of accountability for
learning purposes, I still need to do better on how I want to grow my skillset within this type of software skill.

**Question 4:How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
I'll say this for general use of this question. It has expanded my approach to what I can do in the future for designing software.
Gaming was one of my favorite hobbies growing up, and that also includes the tech-hub, because of the innovation being included in
software and hardware products. I am always fascinated by the design and complex engineering, that people put in to make an amazing product.
While, I know that takes time to perfect over-time, I want to be able to actually put-time in to make up projects for myself in the near-future.
Otherwise, I am not helping myself become better at what I have chosen, but that doesn't mean that I should give up and walk away.

**Question 5: How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
From previous projects, that I have done for other classes in my computer science program, it has helped me to organize, test, and operate my code
on a safe level. Most of the time, I use visual studio for my coding sessions, but I also have other IDEs such as, Eclipse and PyCharm. Even learning to
include comments helps to me keep track of where I am at in a software project, and so importing that into this project allowed me to ensure that nothing was 
out of place.
